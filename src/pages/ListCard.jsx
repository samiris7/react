            From the moment our paths crossed, my heart found a rhythm it never knew it was missing. Every day with you feels like a new chapter in the most beautiful story Iâ€™ve ever read. Your laughter is my favorite symphony, and your smile, a beacon that guides me through even the stormiest days.
